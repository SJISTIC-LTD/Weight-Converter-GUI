Weight conversion means to multiply the value of a unit with the standard conversion value. In this article, I will take you through how to create a weight converter GUI with Python programming language.
The standard weight conversion values include:

1 milligram = 0.001 gram
1 centigram = 0.01 gram
1 decigram = 0.1 gram
1 kilogram = 1000 grams
1 gram = 1000 milligrams
1 ton = 2000 pounds
1 pound = 16 ounces
